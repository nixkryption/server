## Development Strategy

### Test-Driven Development 🧪
1. **Unit Tests First**: Write tests for core business logic before implementation
2. **Integration Tests**: Test exchange API integrations with mock responses
3. **Contract Tests**: Ensure exchange API compatibility
4. **End-to-End Tests**: Full workflow testing

### Best Practices ⭐
- Start with one exchange, perfect it, then add others
- Use precise decimal arithmetic for all financial calculations
- Implement comprehensive error handling and logging
- Follow Rust idioms and patterns
- Maintain high test coverage (>80%)
- Use structured logging for debugging and monitoring

## Module Responsibilities Summary

| Module | Primary Responsibility | Key Files | What It Does |
|--------|----------------------|-----------|--------------|
| **exchanges/** | 🏦 Exchange Integration | `traits.rs`, `deribit/client.rs` | Connects to crypto exchanges, handles API calls |
| **data/** | 📊 Data Management | `ingestion.rs`, `storage.rs` | Processes & stores market data, order books, trades |
| **orders/** | 📋 Order Management | `manager.rs`, `routing.rs` | Manages order lifecycle, decides where to route orders |
| **api/** | 🌐 Frontend Interface | `rest.rs`, `websocket.rs` | Provides API endpoints for frontend communication |
| **services/** | 🏗️ Business Logic | `portfolio.rs`, `risk.rs` | Core trading logic, risk management, portfolio tracking |
| **common/** | 🔧 Shared Utilities | `types.rs`, `error.rs` | Common types and utilities used across all modules |
| **config/** | ⚙️ Configuration | `settings.rs` | Manages app settings, API keys, environment variables |

## Current Status
- [x] ✅ Initial project setup
- [ ] 🏗️ Phase 1: Foundation
- [ ] 🏦 Phase 2: Single Exchange Integration
- [ ] 📋 Phase 3: Order Management System
- [ ] 🌐 Phase 4: Multi-Exchange Support
- [ ] 🌐 Phase 5: API & Frontend Integration

## Notes 📝
- Focus on Deribit first as it has excellent documentation
- Use `rust_decimal` for all price calculations to avoid floating-point errors
- Implement proper error handling from the start
- Consider using event sourcing for order state management
- Plan for high-frequency trading requirements from the beginning

## Risk Management Considerations ⚖️
- Always validate orders before submission
- Implement position size limits
- Add balance checks before order placement
- Monitor for unusual market conditions
- Implement circuit breakers for risk control
